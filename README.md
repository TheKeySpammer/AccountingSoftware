## Objective
It's difficult to make informed business decisions without accurate financial data that helps
you see where you are, where you've been and trends that may determine where you're
headed.
The objective of our project is to provide Indian Business with modern secure and a
powerful accounting software that is easy to learn and provides many useful utilities to
manage account of a business.

## Introduction
Accounting software is a class of computer programs that enable you to manage your
business's financial transactions. Such programs can vary widely in scope, with some
programs designed for little more than simple bookkeeping and some designed to manage
the entire financial comings and goings of large businesses.
Using accounting software helps companies to use the resources in their accounting
departments efficiently, and can reduce costly bookkeeping mistakes.
Most Indian Business don’t invest in personal software that provides powerful utilities as
standalone software’s do. But Indian market lacks a modern accounting software with
functionalities like inbuilt spreadsheets, online sharing etc.
Our software is a lightweight and user friendly alternative to other available accounting
software which are usually too costly for small businesses to afford. Our solution aims at
providing an easy to learn accounting software with modern and intuitive UI.
As students we are motivated to get our hands on a real world problem and in the process
of creating a solution we will learn many industry level skills and technology which will help
us become better software developers.
